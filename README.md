# Fireworks Simulation 🎆

This project is a 2D fireworks simulation developed in Python using the Pygame library.  
It demonstrates fundamental computer graphics concepts such as particle systems,
animation, alpha blending, and basic gravity-based physics.

## Features
- 2D particle system simulation
- Randomized fireworks explosions
- Gravity-based motion
- Alpha blending and fade-out effects
- Mouse click to trigger fireworks

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Pygame

## Installation
Install the required library using pip:
```bash
pip install pygame
How to Run

Run the following command in the project directory:
python main.py
Project Purpose

This project was created as part of a Computer Graphics university course to
demonstrate animation and particle system concepts using Python.
